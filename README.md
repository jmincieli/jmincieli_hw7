This project was to create a small web survey to collect information on students such as their name, hometown information, as well as some infomation about their University of Iowa enrollment. This form includes 5 total pages with 3 survey question pages.

What I did to ensure best practices for my form was ensure use of proper language when describing gender and ethnicity as well as label each of my response ids for efficient database management.

What I did to make my page more accessible was use alt text on all images and icons and proper color contrast for impaired vision users.
